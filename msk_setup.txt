### Setting up MSK



After setup, we need to access it from EC2

Start new EC2 linux instance with SSM Role

```shell
# add this in startup config so that it installs the ssm manager when created automatically
#!bin/bash cd /tmp curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm -o amazon-ssm-agent.rpm yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent.rpm

```

* Can now access this ec2 instance from Systems Manager
* Need to set up and install kafka to create brokers using the following commands

```shell
# install java
sudo yum install java-1.8.0

# install kafak
# make sure to add sudo here again
sudo wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.2.1/kafka_2.12-2.2.1.tgz
```
